# Sorting algorithm BogoSort as a benchmark
Sorting algorithm BogoSort is very simple: it just randomly shuffle values in array, until a miracle happens and the array is sorted

This benchmark requires Python 3. To run the benchmark, you need to write in the command line `python bogosort_[language].py` and select count of values in array to sort. This benchmark test how fast Python shuffle array on your system.

Here is my results:
